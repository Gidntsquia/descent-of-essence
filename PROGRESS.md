Picked up a task from a prior (pre-routine) conversation that got cut off by a session
usage-limit hit right after `js/wordbound/tiles.js` was written but before it was wired
into anything. Finished the Slay the Spire-style deck rework for Wordbound per Jaxon's
original 4 requirements:

1. Fixed 12-tile starter deck every run (`Tiles.createStarterDeck`).
2. After every fight, pick 1 of 3 random tiles to permanently add to the deck (new
   `TILE_REWARD` screen, skippable via a Skip button).
3. Rare tiles (~18% of reward rolls) carry a bonus: flat score bonus when played, score
   multiplier when played, or score multiplier when held or not played that turn.
4. After every word is played, the whole rack (played tiles + unplayed leftovers) is
   discarded and a fresh full rack is drawn.

Architecture: `state.deck` (persistent tile array, grows via rewards) is separate from
`state.pile` (`{ drawPile, discardPile }`, reset fresh each fight by shuffling the deck).
The rack now holds tile objects (`{ id, letter, bonus }`) instead of plain letter chars,
so `Lexicon.canFormFromRack`/`removeTiles`/`scoreWord` and `Combat.playWord` all changed
to operate on tile identity (matters for duplicate letters where only one copy has a
bonus). `Combat.playWord` now returns `holdMult` (from MULT_ON_HOLD tiles left in the
rack) in addition to the trait multiplier; `damage = round(score.total * holdMult *
traitMult)`. The old letter-bag (`Lexicon.createBag`/`drawTiles`, `state.bag`) is gone.

Two existing items needed updating for the new pile-based ctx shape: `lucky_vowel`
(onDraw hook now searches `pileState.drawPile` instead of a flat bag) and
`wildcard_pouch` (onRunStart hook now pushes 2 blank tiles into that fight's draw pile
instead of a bag). `heavy_ink` needed a one-line fix since `ctx.tilesUsed` entries are now
tile objects, not raw letters.

Verification done: full syntax check on every changed file; a from-scratch headless
harness (loads the actual module files into a shimmed `window`, no browser) exercising
starter deck creation, reward rolls producing bonus tiles, draw-pile/discard-pile
reshuffling (including the empty-both-piles edge case), canFormFromRack's blank
preference, removeTiles matching by tile id (not just letter — verified with two 'E'
tiles where only one has a bonus, confirming the right instance is removed), scoreWord's
flat/mult bonus math, a full Combat.playWord round trip with a held MULT_ON_HOLD tile,
the unplayable-word null path, and both updated item hooks. All passed. Also
cross-checked every DOM id `game.js` looks up against `wordbound.html` — no mismatches.

**Not done:** an actual in-browser playtest. The Chrome extension wasn't connected in
this session, so the new `TILE_REWARD` screen, the bonus-tile highlight/tooltip on rack
tiles, and general game-feel haven't been eyeballed by a human or a real DOM. Logic is
verified; visuals/UX are not. That's the queued QA/polish task above — whichever run
picks it up next should playtest a full run in an actual browser if it can, or ask Jaxon
to spot-check if it can't render one either.

Also note: the reward screen offers a Skip button even though Jaxon's spec didn't
explicitly ask for one -- added because requirement #2 said "you *can* add" a tile,
which reads as optional. Flagging in case that's not what was wanted.

**IMPORTANT for whoever picks up the next task:** the hourly routine is temporarily
PAUSED (`enabled: false`). Read this whole entry before assuming anything is broken
in the code.

What happened: a manually-triggered run (session cse_017NbPx6jo1U7kAo3gTxZXdg,
02:59-03:07 UTC) did excellent work -- completed the QA pass, applied the THEME.md
naming, built a deck viewer, built an item inspector, and added rack animation +
drag-to-reorder (5 of the then-remaining 6 tasks). But **every commit failed to push
with `403 Forbidden`**, and the whole session's work was stranded in that sandbox and
is now unrecoverable -- none of it reached `main`. Diagnosis: this repo's only
collaborator is Jaxon's own GitHub account (checked via `gh api
repos/Gidntsquia/descent-of-essence/collaborators`); there's no bot/app installed with
push access, so the cloud routine's sandbox had no credential to push with at all. The
repo is public, so cloning/reading worked fine, which is why the run got all the way
through doing real work before failing at the very last step.

This means **every future run will hit the identical wall** until Jaxon connects
GitHub write access for the Claude Code cloud environment (this needs to happen on
claude.ai directly -- not something fixable from inside a routine run). I've paused
the routine and flagged this to him directly rather than let it keep burning cycles on
work that can't land.

**Queue status is NOT what a stranded session's local commits would suggest.** As
actually reflected on `main`: task 1 (deck rework) and task 4 (dictionary, done
separately -- see the entry above this one from the live session, not the routine)
are the only ones checked off. Tasks 2 (QA pass), 3 (theme), 5 (deck viewer), 6 (item
inspector), and 7 (rack animation/drag) are still unchecked and still need doing --
the stranded session's work on them is gone, not merged. Don't skip them thinking
they're done. Whoever resumes this queue after the routine is re-enabled: start from
task 2 as normal. The good news is a single Haiku run demonstrably got through 5 of
those in under 8 minutes once before, so redoing them shouldn't be slow.
